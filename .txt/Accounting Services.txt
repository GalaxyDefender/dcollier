Description:
Have you recently formed your own business?
Are you finding your monthly bookkeeping an added administrative burden?
 
Your business's financial wellbeing relies on regular, correctly kept books of account. Though it may take longer, it is correct procedure to capture from source documentation to bank statement and not just from your bank statement. Performance of regular reconciliations will eliminate any chance of human error in the processing of financial information.
 
The best way to focus on the more important day to day requirements for your business is to outsource the burden of monthly bookkeeping.
 
Our diligent staff will process from shoebox records to final trial balance and offer monthly management accounts should you wish to have visual cash flow charts, monthly projections, budgets and the like. These management accounts are available should you be applying for financial growth assistance. Our principal, Mrs Leigh Bainbridge, is available to discuss your monthly records and assist or advise on financial matters related to your business.
 
Further to our bookkeeping service, our friendly staff is available on a consultancy basis for bookkeeping support. We are a registered pastel agent and offer assistance in setting your pastel up to best suite your needs.
