DO YOU HAVE THE TIME TO ADMINISTER ALL THIS?
 
You can ensure your compliance of all legislated requirements through our Company Secretarial service.
 
Your statutory file is required to be kept up to date in order to stay compliant with CIPC. There is a close relationship between SARS and CIPC and non compliance with one could effect your compliance with the other. Your statutory file is required for your company's annual audit.
 
Your file will be maintained and updated throughout the year and we will attend to all other CIPC requirements as and when they arise.
